            Pepe was originally created by cartoonist Matt Furie. He designed Pepe as a green, human-like frog
            and first published it in his 2005 webcomic <i>Boy’s Club</i>. Its popularity grew through websites
            like Myspace and 4chan around 2008. Soon, different variations of the Pepe meme appeared, such as
            <b>“Sad Frog”</b> and <b>“Angry Pepe.”</b><br><br>
            By 2012, Sad Pepe began appearing on Tumblr, and by 2014, versions surfaced on Chinese media. 
            Eventually, <b>“Rare Pepes”</b> were sold online.<br><br>
            By 2015, Pepe was the most retweeted meme on Twitter and ranked #6 on <i>Daily News and Analysis</i>’s list. 
            However, Pepe was later used as a hate symbol, and in May 2017, Furie retired the character.<br><br>

        <div class="meme-text">
            Leeroy Jenkins comes from a video titled <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4" target="_blank">Leeroy!!</a></b>, released by a World of Warcraft (WoW)<br>
    guild called "Pals For Life" on the WoW video site WarcraftMovies on May 11, 2005.<br>
    The video shows a group of players making a plan for their next fight. During this<br>
    discussion, Leeroy—a member of the group—is away from his computer making a plate of chicken.<br>
    The goal of the plan is to get Leeroy a piece of armor from the in-game monsters. But after<br>
    they finalize the plan, Leeroy comes back online, says <i>"Let’s do this!"</i>, and rushes into the<br>
    cave where the monsters are—shouting his name as a battle cry: <b>"LEEEROYYYY JENKIIINNNSSS!"</b><br>
    In disbelief, one member says, “Oh my God, he just ran in.” Moments later, the rest of the team<br>
    rushes in to try and save him, but without a plan, they all die. The guild members start mocking<br>
    Leeroy, to which he replies: <i>"At least I have chicken!"</i><br>
    <br>
    The video became a full-blown internet meme when it was posted to the WoW forums in a thread called<br>
    <i>"UBRS (vid) Rookery Overpowered! blue plz."</i> The thread framed the video more seriously, claiming<br>
    that Blizzard (the company behind WoW) should make the encounter less difficult, and asked other<br>
    players for strategies to beat it—causing the clip to spread quickly.<br>
    <br> 
    In 2017, it was revealed that the video was staged. In 2022, Blizzard even added a <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/cards/559">
    Legendary card called Leeroy Jenkins</a> to one of there card games

    <img class="meme-image" src="rick-astley-340x252.png" alt="Rickroll" width="340" height="252">
    <div class="meme-text">
        Rickroll comes from the 1987 song <i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Never Gonna Give You Up</a> </i> by Rick Astley, 
        released on his debut album <i> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6eUW0wxWtzkFdaEFsTJto6">Whenever You Need Somebody</a> </i>. The song hit number 1 on many charts.<br><br>

        An early version of “Rickrolling” started in 2006 on the 4chan imageboard through a prank called 
        “duckrolling.” A site filter replaced the word “egg” with “duck,” and users created a meme of 
        a duck on wheels. When people clicked misleading links, they’d see the duck image along with the phrase 
        “You’ve been duckrolled.”<br><br>

        In March 2007, when the first trailer for <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> was released, Rockstar’s site 
        crashed from heavy traffic. To prank users, a 4chan member named Scott Cotter posted a link to 
        <i>Never Gonna Give You Up</i>, claiming it was the trailer. This became the first “Rickroll.”<br><br>

        The prank spread rapidly across 4chan, Fark, Digg, and later mainstream platforms. By April 2008, 
        a poll revealed that 18 million U.S. adults had been Rickrolled. That same year, Rick Astley himself 
        said he found the meme “hilarious” and chose not to capitalize on it.<br><br>

        The meme has remained popular ever since, and as of August 19, 2025, the music video has 
        over <b>1.6 billion views</b> on YouTube. <b></b>

    <img class="meme-image" src="orange.jpg" alt="Annoying Orange meme" width="300" height="300">
    <div class="meme-text">
        Annoying Orange started as an animated comedy series on YouTube by Dane Boedigheimer in 2009. 
        The series follows a talking orange who lives in a kitchen with other fruits, vegetables, utensils, 
        and objects. Each episode usually follows a similar format: Orange annoys the others by cracking jokes, 
        calling them names, burping, or just “breaking wind.” Though he usually means well, at the end of most episodes 
        one character meets a gruesome death—often by a chef’s knife. Orange usually tries to warn them by shouting 
        the weapon’s name (“Knife!”).<br><br>

        In newer episodes, the format sometimes changes, but Orange is always annoying. There are six main recurring 
        characters besides Orange: Pear, Passion Fruit, Marshmallow, Midget Apple, and Grandpa Lemon. Other characters 
        like Squash and Dr. Bananas also appear throughout the series.<br><br>

        The series became increasingly popular, spawning memes, remixes, and even games. As of August 20th, 2025, 
        the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnnoyingOrange/featured">Annoying Orange YouTube channel</a> has amassed over <b>10 million subscribers</b>.<br><br>
