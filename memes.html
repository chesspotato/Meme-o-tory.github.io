    <h1>The History of Memes</h1>

    <p>Memes have been around for longer than you might think! The term <strong>"meme"</strong> was first coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" target="_blank">Richard Dawkins</a> in 1976 to describe an idea that spreads from person to person like a gene.</p>

    <h2>🕸️ Internet Meme Origins (1990s)</h2>
    <p>The internet brought memes to life in new ways. Early memes were shared through email chains and forums. Some classics include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>💃 The Hampster Dance (1998)</li>
      <li>🕺 All Your Base Are Belong to Us</li>
      <li>🎵 Peanut Butter Jelly Time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📈 Meme Boom (2000s)</h2>
    <p>In the early 2000s, image macros took over. Sites like <a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com" target="_blank">I Can Has Cheezburger?</a> made LOLcats famous. Memes became fast, funny, and viral. This era gave us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>😼 Ceiling Cat</li>
      <li>🧒 Success Kid</li>
      <li>😡 Rage Comics</li>
      <li>🐸 Pepe the Frog (before it got weird)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📱 Meme Modernization (2010s and beyond)</h2>
    <p>Memes now dominate social media — especially platforms like Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter. They're shorter, often video-based, and constantly changing.</p>
